Most of the python codes under folder "f". Simple python scripts with many nested loop. Data process and Writiing Codes takes 1-2 month while rewrite the original drafts takes more than half a year. Finally I give up on this endless and meaningless work after around one year battle with the journal editor's suggestion. 

Luckily its got published. End of my meteorology life. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S130910422100310X?via%3Dihub#!


## **Abstract**

To understand the impact of the climatic and socioeconomic factors on air pollutants during COVID-19 lockdown, we divided 358 Chinese prefectural cities into eight climate zoness. Each climate zone has different diffusion, removal and emission conditionsdifferent conditions of emission source and dispersion. Spatial, temporal and diurnal variations of the air pollutants from January 1 to April 18, 2020 were analyzed. The pollutant concentration reduction was more significant in the regions with active economy and worse diffusion conditions. PM2.5 decreased by 64.2%–59.0% in the temperate zones while merely decreased by 26.1%–17.0% in the south subtropical regions and the plateau zones. PM10 declined in most regions but increased by 48.9% and 21.7% instead in the arid temperate zone and plateau zone. SO2 and CO reductions were around 20%–30% in the subtropical and plateau zones while 41.1%–47.1% (SO2) and 63.6%–47.4% (CO) in temperate zones. NO2 dropped by 57.7%–49.1% generally but rebounded earlier in high GDP and vehicle population regions. O3 surged by 79.2 %–115.5% except in the south subtropical and plateau zone where the O3 merely rose by 24%. Despite the emission reduction, more severe pollution events occurred in the temperate zones or high GDP and vehicle population regions. The inhibition of the pollutants' fluctuations was more significant in high emission areas.
